# mothBot
Small-scale Discord bot just for fun, because who doesn't want a lil' moth to hang around the groupchat?

Prefix: moth!

## Commands
#### moth!ping
+ Useful for testing if the bot is running. Replies to you if they're not asleep
#### moth!compliment
+ For when you want to give a fun complimentary greeting, but too lazy to think of one yourself!
+ Strings togther a random positive adjective with a random baked good in the format:
⋅⋅⋅"Heyo, my [adjective] [baked good]!"
⋅⋅⋅ex. "Heyo, my dazzling blueberry muffin!"
+ You can add a word after the command to spice it up with some good ol' time-relevancy
⋅⋅⋅ex. `moth!complement afternoon` gives a result like "Good afternoon, my lovely chocolate chip cookie!"
